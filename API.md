## ```posix-spawn/close```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L101](posix-spawn.janet#L101)

```
    (close p)
    
    Send the process it's close signal and wait for it to exit.
```

## ```posix-spawn/dup```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L111](posix-spawn.janet#L111)

```
    (dup f)

```

## ```posix-spawn/pipe```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L106](posix-spawn.janet#L106)

```
    (pipe)
    
    Create a pair of files created with pipe. The files have the CLOEXEC flag set.
```

## ```posix-spawn/run```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L91](posix-spawn.janet#L91)

```
    (run args &keys kwargs)

```

## ```posix-spawn/run2```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L96](posix-spawn.janet#L96)

```
    (run2 args kwargs)

```

## ```posix-spawn/spawn```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L33](posix-spawn.janet#L33)

```
    (spawn args &keys kwargs)
    
    Spawn a child process using libc posix_spawn. Care
    must be taken with file descriptors that have not had the CLOEXEC flag set, as
    they will be inherited by child processes.
    
    Positional args:
    
    args - A tuple or array of strings or symbols to be used as arguments.
    
    Keyword args:
    
    :cmd
    
    The command to run, defaults to (args 0).
    
    :close-signal
    
    Signal to send process on when close is called. Also
    called when process is garbage collected.
    
    :file-actions
    
    A tuple of file actions the child will take before calling execve.
    
    Valid file action formats:
    
    [:dup2 file1 file2] - Call dup2 on the specified files.
    [:close file] - Close the specified files.
    
    :env
    
    The process environment, defaults to (os/environ)
    
    :attr-flags
    
    A set of spawn flags, see the posix_spawn(3) man page for details.
    Defaults to POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK|POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF|POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS.
    
    :sig-default
    
    A set of signals values to reset to their default handlers.
    As a special case, :all may be passed. nil
    means no signals. Defaults to :all.
    
    :sig-mask
    
    A set of signals to mask. As a special case, :all may be passed.
    nil means no signals. Defaults to nil.
```

## ```posix-spawn/spawn2```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L14](posix-spawn.janet#L14)

```
    (spawn2 args {:cmd cmd :env env :attr-flags attr-flags :close-signal close-signal
    :sig-mask sig-mask :file-actions file-actions :sig-default sig-default})
    
    The same as spawn, but takes a dictionary of arguments instead of &keys style arguments.
```

## ```posix-spawn/wait```
type: function

[posix-spawn.janet#L86](posix-spawn.janet#L86)

```
    (wait p)
    
    Wait for the process to exist and return the exit status.
```
