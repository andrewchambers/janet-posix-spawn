(defn spawn
`
Spawn a child process using libc posix_spawn. Care
must be taken with file descriptors that have not had the CLOEXEC flag set, as
they will be inherited by child processes.

Positional args:

args - A tuple or array of strings or symbols to be used as arguments.

Keyword args:

:cmd

The command to run, defaults to (args 0).

:close-signal

Signal to send process on when close is called. Also
called when process is garbage collected.

:file-actions
  
A tuple of file actions the child will take before calling execve.

Valid file action formats:

[:dup2 file1 file2] - Call dup2 on the specified files.
[:close file] - Close the specified files.

:env

The process environment, defaults to (os/environ)

:attr-flags

A set of spawn flags, see the posix_spawn(3) man page for details.
Defaults to POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK|POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF.

:sig-default

A set of signals values to reset to their default handlers.
As a special case, :all may be passed. nil
means no signals. Defaults to :all. 

:sig-mask

A set of signals to mask. As a special case, :all may be passed.
nil means no signals. Defaults to nil.
